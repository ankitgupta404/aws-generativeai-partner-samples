# LaunchDarkly with Amazon Bedrock Workshop

LaunchDarkly serves a suite of helpful tools that help you ship your code safer, faster, and more effectively with whatever language and frameworks you use today.

## What is a feature flag?

A feature flag is a concept used in software development to enable or disable a feature without modifying your source code or redeploying your app. By leveraging feature flags, you can reduce the risk of new features by rolling them out progressively across subsets of your users over time. Operated using a toggle in the LaunchDarkly user interface (UI), feature flags can be turned on and off for targeted sets of users identified by context or attribute like email, user type, organization, or any arbitrary context you can describe.

## Why are feature flags useful?

Conditionally releasing software to targeted, smaller audiences of users reduces risk in your software development cycle, accelerates the pace with which you can deploy new code, and preserves the quality of your usersâ€™ app experience. Smaller audiences can find unanticipated problems with new features quickly while reducing your support load for each new deployment.

Feature flags become necessary for teams that ship fast. Using feature flags for a new release enables single-click rollback of unintended bugs, end-to-end testing in production, and exposing fledgling features to a targeted set of key customers.

## AI model flags

You can use LaunchDarkly AI model flags to iterate on both models and model configurations so that you can introduce models from new vendors, or iterate on configurations of existing models. For example, you might be using Anthropic Claude Sonnet model today, but want to be able to switch into Anthropic Claude Haiku, and apply specific configurations to influence the accuracy and creativity of responses, or even set a maximum token generation

## AI prompt flags

Similar to AI model flags, you can use AI prompt flags to iterate on prompt configurations as well as to experiment with different configurations to improve the results you receive from interactions with your models. Prompt adjustments are happening often as we learn more about the most effective ways to interact with each other.
