    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will show you how to create a chatbot in Elastic in under 10 minutes!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s say you are tasked by your university to create a proof of concept RAG chatbot for your department, leveraging  Elastic. The goal of the chatbot is to help your organization get answers to questions faster, rather than manually searching to find the information themselves. Your organization has a PDF document that it wants you to test and see if Elastic + AWS will provide accurate RAG search results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Download a pdf file, choose from 1 of these three education based PDF files.\n",

    "Run a query in your chatbot for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Is attendance mandatory? Or can I skip all the in person classes and just submit my work?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check the response of your chatbot against your source PDF documentation. Did it get the correct answer?\n",
    "Check the \"document sources\" and \"Snippet\" from within that chat window.\n",
